Project leARn - AR based app for education and research


Students today are engrossed in their phones all the time. Even little kids get fascinated by the bright screen of a mobile phone and hence they are losing their interest in reading books. Since reading and understanding complicated topics from books requires some kind of creative thinking and imagination power, some people get tired of it at the beginning itself. 

To overcome this common fatigue, we have come up with a solution to make learning more fun. By using AR technology we plan to make the imagining process easier for students. 

Our idea is to make an application where the user will scan a bar code from their mobile phone which will generate a 3D visualization of some particular topic and see it closely. Letâ€™s say as a very basic example- a solar system; the users will be able to see different rotating planets and read more about them in 3D; what are their relative size, etc.

This will enable them to understand better and retain information for long.

In the future, we aim to change the way of learning from textbooks. We propose that books in the future come with small barcodes printed on the footer of each page so that the reader can scan it to gain more insight into the particular topic on that page.
