Project leARn - AR based portal for education and research


Students today are engrossed in their phones all the time. Even little kids get fascinated by the bright screen of a mobile phone and hence they are losing their interest in reading books. Since reading and understanding complicated topics from books requires some kind of creative thinking and imagination power, some people get tired of it at the beginning itself. 

To overcome this common fatigue, we have come up with a solution to make learning more fun. By using AR technology and Web Development we plan to make the imagining process easier for students. 

Our idea is to make an application where students can learn about a particular topic and enter an AR world to explore and see it closely. Letâ€™s say as a very basic example- a solar system; the users will be able to walk into it and see the planets for themselves; see how they rotate about their axis, what are their relative size, how they look in space.

By using the Unity engine, we are also making an application that will scan the image target from a textbook and will produce 3D models in the air. This will enable them to understand better and retain information for long.

In the future, we aim to change the way of learning from textbooks. By using our app, students will be able to scan images from books and see their 3D representation and interact with them.
